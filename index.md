## Roadmap & Development

At **Intrig**, we're on a mission to redefine the future of development through innovative integrations. Our roadmap is a dynamic journey, starting with the building and completion of a robust CLI, with React and OpenAPI3 integrations at its core.

Following this foundation, we'll be expanding into various realms of technology, weaving seamless connections with Angular, OpenAPI2, and Node. The integration journey continues, bridging gaps with Express servers and unleashing the potential of Vue and SQLite.

Our vision doesn't stop with these milestones. We'll keep adapting and growing, introducing similar integrations and enhancing tool functionalities to align with the evolving technological landscape.

Stay tuned as we explore possibilities like integrating AI capabilities such as ChatGPT, bringing us closer to our goal of revolutionizing development even further.

## Monetization & Licensing

At **Intrig**, we believe in accessibility and innovation. While we're leaning towards a free-to-use model, we understand the importance of sustaining and growing our project. We're actively exploring avenues for monetization that align with our core values and community-driven approach.

Licensing is an essential aspect of our project, and we're taking the time to consider the best approach. Our decision will reflect a commitment to openness, collaboration, and ethical development, but we haven't finalized the details just yet.

Join us on this exciting journey and stay tuned for updates on our licensing model. Together, we'll shape a future where technology is not just advanced but also inclusive and responsible.
