Project Name:
Intrig

Project Overview:
You are developing a TypeScript library/framework aimed at integrating backend APIs and databases across various platforms including Angular, React, Vue, and Node. The primary goal is to reduce developer effort and increase reliability. The pilot project for React was successful.

Framework Components:

CLI for meta-level tasks (config management, code generation, initialization).
Runtime utilities to run generated code.
A plugin-based system for technology-specific functionalities (e.g., an OpenAPI3 plugin for Swagger and a React plugin for generating hooks).
Roadmap & Development:
At Intrig, you're on a mission to redefine the future of development through innovative integrations. The roadmap starts with building a robust CLI with React and OpenAPI3 integrations. It then expands into various technologies like Angular, OpenAPI2, Node, Express servers, Vue, and SQLite. The vision includes continuous adaptations and growth, with plans to integrate AI capabilities such as ChatGPT to further revolutionize development.

Monetization & Licensing:
You're considering a free-to-use model but are also exploring ways to monetize the framework. You're leaning towards a copyleft license to prevent plagiarism and ensure contributions are open-sourced.

Marketing:
You've crafted a Jekyll homepage for the project, looking to use visuals, SEO, call-to-action buttons, testimonials, analytics, newsletters, accessibility, mobile optimization, and updated links to create an engaging website. You're also looking for tools and strategies to market the framework once it's ready.
